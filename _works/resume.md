This project implements a streamlined process for deploying my resume website to an AWS S3 bucket utilizing Pulumi for Infrastructure-as-Code, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and Jekyll as the static site generator. By implementing Cloudflare as a proxy to the S3 bucket, I ensured fast and reliable hosting for my site due to Cloudflare's caching abilities. 

GitHub Actions automation simplified the deployment workflow, enabling seamless updates to my resume website whenever changes were made to the GitHub repository. Jekyll provided the framework for generating the static content of the site, allowing for easy customization and maintenance.
